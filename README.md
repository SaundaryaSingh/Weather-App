# Weather-App

This Weather App is a responsive and user-friendly web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search for any city around the world and instantly view the current weather information along with a 4-day forecast. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions such as clear skies, rain, clouds, snow, and more. Each condition is represented with a dynamic weather icon for better visual clarity.
